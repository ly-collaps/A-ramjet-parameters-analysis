# A-ramjet-parameters-analysis
A code that shows the variation of the ramjet parameters (specific thrust, specific fuel consumption, fuel air ratio and the thermal efficiency) as the tau_lambda and tau_r ratio vary for different Mach numbers.

#Variation of tau_r RAMJET ANALYSIS 
In this code, the tau_lambda is fixed as a parameter ( that can change manually from 6 to 10) and tau_r is in function of Mach number that varies from 0 to 4 with a step=0.1. In this way the graph contains lines chart for tau_r = 6,7,8,9,10

#Variation of tau_lambda RAMJET ANALYSIS 
In this code, the tau_r is fixed as a parameter ( that can change manually from 100 to 250) and tau_lambda is in function of Mach number that varies from 0 to 4 with a step=0.1. In this way the graph contains lines chart for tau_r = 100,150,200,220,250.
